The Game Rules:
- It is an interesting game, once you start the mole will popup in any random cell of the 4x4 grid.
- The goal is to smash the mole with a mouse click before it disappears.
- If you got it right the cell will lit up with green light.
- So hit as much as you can within 1 minute and the number of correct hits will be your final Score.
